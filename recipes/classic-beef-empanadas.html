    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 medium potatoes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>2 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>¾ cup green olives, pitted and chopped</li>
      <li>2 hard-cooked eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>24 empanada pastry rounds</li>
      <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil.
        Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until barely tender, about 8
        minutes. Drain. Once cool enough to handle, peel and cut into cubes. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet and cook onion and green
        onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Add bell pepper and cook for 3
        minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5
        minutes. Season with paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove beef mixture from heat; add potatoes and olives. Stir in chopped
        hard-cooked eggs; set filling aside to cool, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets
        with aluminum foil and lightly grease with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place an empanada pastry round on a flat surface and lightly wet the
        edges with warm water. Put a large tablespoon of cooled filling in the
        center and fold dough over. Seal edges by pressing with a fork. Repeat
        with remaining rounds and filling. Transfer empanadas to the prepared
        baking sheets and brush with beaten egg.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
