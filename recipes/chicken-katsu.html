        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This recipe can also be
          used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve
          with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Chicken:</strong> You'll need four skinless, boneless
            chicken breast halves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Seasonings:</strong> This chicken katsu recipe is simply
            seasoned with salt and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps seal in the
            moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko
            something to stick to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Panko:</strong> Panko bread crumbs are responsible for
            katsu's signature crunch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Oil:</strong> Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point,
            such as canola or vegetable oil.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place
            flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes.
            Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg,
            and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in
            the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side.
            Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
