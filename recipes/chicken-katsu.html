    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This recipe can also be
      used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with
      white rice and tonkatsu sauce.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Chicken:</strong> You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken
        breast halves.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seasonings:</strong> This chicken katsu recipe is simply
        seasoned with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture,
        adds flavor, and promotes browning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something
        to stick to.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Panko:</strong> Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's
        signature crunch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oil:</strong> Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point,
        such as canola or vegetable oil.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour,
        beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken
        breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press
        into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the
        hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer
        to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
      </li>
    </ol>
